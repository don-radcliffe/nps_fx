Workspace for the NPS Fire Effects data analysis from North Cascades and Lake Roosevelt Recreation Areas in Washington State.  This analysis is led by Don Radcliffe, PhD student in the Harvey Lab at the University of Washington (UW), and will form a part of his dissertation.  Karen Kopper (UW and National Park Service [NPS]) supervised much of the underlying fieldwork and is collaborating in analysis and manuscript development.  Brian Harvey (UW) is Don's PhD adviser and is also collaborating.  Questions and feedback can be directed to DR at dradclif@uw.edu or donaldradcliffe91@gmail.com, or to Karen Kopper at kkopper@uw.edu or Karen_kopper@nps.gov, or can be submitted as an issue at the Github repo, https://github.com/don-radcliffe/nps_fx.

The goal of this project is to assess the rate of fuel accumulation after different combinations of forest fuels reduction treatments such as thinning and burning.  Single entry vs. multiple entry treatment is of particular interest.  The NPS Fire Effects monitoring program in Washington began in 1996, and has been monitoring an increasing number of thinning, broadcast burning, and pile burning projects since. Plots are sampled before treatment and 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, and 15 years after the last treatment, and that timeline starts over each time a new treatment is implemented on a plot.  In total there are more than 600 plot reads at more than 150 plots, with varying combinations of treatment histories including many with multiple thinning and/or burning entries.

Data collection follows FFI (FEAT/FIREMON Integrated) protocols; see the 'protocols' folder for more information. Response variables collected include surface fuels, canopy trees, shrubs, understory plants, and tree regeneration.  Our project focuses mainly on surface fuel, shrub, and tree information.  

The analysis is partially funded by a Washington Legislative grant for studying fuels treatment longevity, which was led by Derek Churchill at the Washington Department of Natural Resources (WDNR).  

This README was written by DR and will be updated as the project develops, as of 2021 April 5 the analyses are in the very beginning stages.
